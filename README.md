# a-bridge-for-tom

An analysis of Times of Malta (ToM) article comments, showcasing engagement-based vs bridging-based ranking systems. The goal of this project is to seek ways in which constructive and respectful interactions among commenters can be encouraged.

ToM was chosen due to its observed polarisation and contentious nature within the comment section. As a reader myself, I was particularly interested in addressing and improving the tone and substance of discussions on the platform.

1,857 articles and their comments were gathered between February and July 2024.
