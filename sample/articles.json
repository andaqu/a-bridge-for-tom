        "title": "'People should ask why inquiry treated Muscat and other officials unfairly' - PM",
        "description": "Abela tells reporters he did not see inquiry, but pokes specific holes in it",
        "content": "Joseph Muscat and other officials who face criminal charges in court over the hospitals' inquiry are innocent until proven guilty and there is no reason why they should be kicked out of their positions, Robert Abela said on Monday. The Vitals magisterial inquiry is riddled with unjust accusations, said the prime minister, who insisted, however, he had not seen the inquiry which sparked a political earthquake. In a press conference shortly after it was confirmed that criminal charges were filed against former prime minister Joseph Muscat and almost 20 other individuals and companies, Abela stopped short of saying the inquiry does not hold water because it was unfair on these people.  Abela also said he has no intention of asking Muscat to leave the party or sack him, insisting he is still innocent and the courts are yet to determine whether he ever did anything wrong and whether any of his rights were breached. Abela also said he expects legal challenges to the inquiry and the way it was carried out, and shot down suggestions that Muscat has had €30m worth of assets frozen. Abela, again, continuously said all of this was the work of the “establishment” and, again, failed to specify to identify the people behind it, at one point even suggesting some of the reporters’ questions were influenced or fuelled by the so-called “establishment”.  ",
